# Tik Tok Claims Classification Project

Welcome to the repository for the TikTok Claims Classification Project, completed as part of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate on Coursera! In this project, I took on the role of a data analyst, collaborating with TikTok's data team to develop a machine learning model for classifying claims made in videos submitted to the platform.

Each course in the certificate included a final project that contributed to the overall development of this model. In this repository, you will find Jupyter notebooks and various supporting documents (e.g. executive summaries, Tableau visualizations) completed during these end-of-course projects.


Project Outline:

Course 1: Creating a project proposal for the TikTok data team in the form of a PACE strategy document.

Course 2: Conducting initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python to identify variables of interest in TikTok's data set.

Course 3: Deriving insights from the data through visualizations in Python and Tableau.

Course 4: Performing hypothesis tests to analyze the relationships between key variables.

Course 5: Building and evaluating a logistic regression model.

Course 6: Developing and evaluating Random Forest, NLP, and XGBoost machine learning models to select the champion classifier for identifying claims.


Thank you for exploring this project. Your feedback is highly appreciated!
