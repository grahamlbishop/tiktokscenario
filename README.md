# tiktokscenario

Welcome to the repository for the TikTok Scenario Project I completed through the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate on Coursera! In this scenario, I played the role of a data analyst working with the rest of TikTok's data team to create a machine learning model for classifying claims made in videos submitted to the platform.

Each course in the certificate concluded with a final project that marked another stage in the development of this model. You will find the Jupyter notebooks and various supporting documents (e.g. executive summaries) that I completed for these end-of-course projects in this repository.

Course 1: Creating a project proposal for the TikTok data team in the form of a PACE strategy document

Course 2: Using Python to conduct initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and isolate variables of interest in TikTok's data set.

Course 3: Gathering insights from the data through visualizations in Python and Tableau

Course 4: Conducting hypothesis tests to analyze the relationship between variables of interest

Course 5: Building and evaluating a logistic regression model.

Course 6: Building and evaluating random forest classifier,  NLP, and XGBoost machine learning models for the purposes of selecting a champion claims classication model.
